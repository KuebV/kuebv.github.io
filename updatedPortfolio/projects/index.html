    <p class="project-card-description">
        Paradox Password Manager is a project I started after hearing about LastPass's data breach, and I wondered if there was a better way of storing passwords. So I went off to make my own version of a password manager.
        It has the bare essentials, but it does all that it needs to, and securely. Using AES Encryption, we're able to create a key that keeps our passwords secure.
    </p>

    <p class="project-card-description">
        AES requires that a salt be defined as part of the process, this salt is directly tied to your computer. So in the case of the application getting into the wrong hands, your passwords will be safe.

    <p class="project-card-description"> Properties is an idea that sounds good on paper, then in practicality, it turns out to be a headache. Bringing the infamous .properties file extension from Java to other languages such as C# and C++, how hard could that be? </p>
    <p class="project-card-description">With the C# version of Properties, we utilize Reflection to take the class that we want to convert into a properties file. Using this, we're able to convert to and from and vise versa. This means we're able to read directly from the file, and write the value for use in the application.</p>
    <p class="project-card-description">Bringing this to C++ was a challenge for sure, not only do we not have the power of reflection, converting data types is significantly harder. My solution is to just leave it up to the developer to handle the data that's read from the file and let them parse it in any way they desire</p>

    <p class="project-card-description">Biotransformer Assistant was an application that was written for the Audrey Hendricks Research Group in University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</p>
    <p class="project-card-description">The goal of the application was to assist in the process of parsing, and handling hundreds of environmental compounds and chemicals and finding their corresponding SMILES (Simplified Molecular Identifier Line Entry System)</p>
    <p class="project-card-description">This project went through 3 major iterations, to improve upon the last version, such as a GUI, API Implementation, and Local Server Handling</p>
